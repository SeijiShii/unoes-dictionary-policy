## 📋 About This Test

To publish an app on Google Play Store, we need at least a dozen users to install the app and use it regularly for over two weeks.

This closed test is designed to meet those requirements. Thank you for your cooperation!

## 💳 Subscription Feature

We would appreciate it if you could also test the subscription feature.

**Please Note**:

- Purchases made with test accounts will not result in actual charges
- Test periods are set very short: the 1-month plan expires in about 5 minutes, and the 1-year plan expires in about 30 minutes
- Auto-renewal is enabled, so you will receive an email each time it renews (which can be quite annoying)
- **Please cancel your subscription after testing is complete**
